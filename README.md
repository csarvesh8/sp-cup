# sp-cup
Here's a folder 'sp cup' containing: 5 normal and 5 abnormal videos, frames extracted from each video, csv files containing the features(based on similarities between two consecutive frames) derived from key point extraction using on an average 35,65,95 consecutive frame pairs for each video and SPC.ipynb which is the code. The code runs by taking videos from the folder Videos SP Cup, forms 10 new folders containing the frames and forms csv files named mycsv and numbered from 1 to 10. To run the code again, just delete the freshly created files and folders from your device.
